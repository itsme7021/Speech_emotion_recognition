# Speech_emotion_recognition
A machine learning model to determine emotions using speech.

I took the data from the internet to train and test my model and in addition, I also created a program for creating audio files so one can expand the dataset and increase the model's accuracy.

The model is capable of distinguishing between numerous types of emotions.
